# Benford's Law Implemention using JavaScript.
## Benford's law, also known as the Newcombâ€“Benford law, the law of anomalous numbers, or the first-digit law, is an observation that in many real-life sets of numerical data, the leading digit is likely to be small.[1] In sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant digit less than 5?% of the time. If the digits were distributed uniformly, they would each occur about 11.1?% of the time.[2] Benford's law also makes predictions about the distribution of second digits, third digits, digit combinations, and so on.
